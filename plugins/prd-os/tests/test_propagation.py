"""Regression test for the prd-os artifact propagation contract.

`kipi-update.sh` rsyncs `q-system/` from the skeleton repo into every
registered instance. The rsync excludes a fixed set of directories so each
instance can maintain instance-local state under those paths without being
overwritten by `kipi update`. The prd-os plugin depends on this exclusion:
`q-system/memory/working/prd-personas-baseline.md` is appended to by
`plugins/prd-os/scripts/phase0_measure.py` per-instance and would silently
break if the exclusion were ever removed.

This test reads the real `kipi-update.sh` from the repo root, locates the
rsync invocation that propagates `q-system/`, captures the contiguous flag
block, and asserts the three protected paths are excluded inside that
specific rsync block. A substring match on the script body alone would not
catch a refactor that left the flags present but disconnected from the
relevant propagation call; this test reads the rsync call as a structured
unit instead.

Exception to the standard fake_repo pattern: this test reads a real file
from the repo root (`kipi-update.sh`) rather than building an ephemeral
fixture under tmp_path. The read is read-only against a stable artifact;
no state mutation, no side effects.
