"""Override-in-place contract (fable-override-in-place).

Every hard ban in the discipline skill states its legitimate override in the
SAME paragraph as the ban: a ban with no documented escape hatch trains the
model to route around the whole skill instead (the taste-skill production
lesson: absolutist prose without an escape hatch decays into ignored prose).
Hook-enforced bans additionally name their skip marker in place, one marker
per hook, no stacking (skill-hook-pairing.md).

A ban unit = a list item (bullet or numbered) or blank-line-separated block
containing the word "never" (the skill's hard-ban verb; softer guidance uses
other phrasing on purpose). Per-ITEM granularity matters: a whole contiguous
bullet list is one blank-line paragraph, so one item's marker would mask a
naked sibling ban (codex major, this issue). An override signal = a skip
marker, or an explicit condition ("unless", "Override:", "Exception:",
"escape hatch").

Explicitly excluded, non-normative by design:
- EXAMPLE.md — worked narrative, not rule text.
- references/fable-discipline-v1.md — the frozen pre-merge archive
  (discipline-skill-versioning); editing it would break the freeze contract
  (`diff -q` against the v1 receipt), so it keeps the old phrasing forever.
