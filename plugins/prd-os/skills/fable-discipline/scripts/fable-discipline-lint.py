fable-discipline-lint.py — Deterministic test-isolation enforcer.

Pairs with the fable-discipline skill (SKILL.md). Enforces the one mechanically
checkable slice of that skill's "verify against a copy, never the live resource"
rule: a TEST file must not name a real data path. Tests use a temp copy, a
tempfile, or :memory:.

This is the graded-good Fable habit (it migrated a COPY of the live prod DB to
prove idempotency) turned into a consistent guardrail, because an independent
Codex review caught a sibling test risking mutation of the live founder DB.

Usage:
    python3 fable-discipline-lint.py <file_path>   # CLI mode
    (no args)                                 # hook mode: PostToolUse JSON on stdin

Exit codes:
    0 = clean (or out of scope)
    2 = violation (a test names a non-isolated data path)

Override:
    Add  # fable-discipline-lint-skip  anywhere in the file to bypass.

Detector coverage (enumerated on purpose, per the hook-blind-spots rule):
    CATCHES  a quoted literal that is a real DB path — has a path separator AND a
             DB extension (.db/.sqlite/.sqlite3/.duckdb) — and is not isolated,
             in ANY use except a comparison/assertion. That covers a direct
             connect("...")/open("..."), every assignment form (plain, augmented
             +=, walrus :=, dict/subscript/attr target), and a literal nested
             inside an f-string. The path-separator requirement is what lets
             `tmp_path / "t.db"` through: the bare filename "t.db" has no
             separator, and isolation lives in the temp variable.
    SKIPS    comparison/assertion lines (assert ..., ==, !=), where the literal
             is being checked, not used — e.g. an OSS-secrets audit test
             asserting the live path is NAMED in a report.
    MISSES   (documented deferrals, each a low-likelihood shape that would add
             false-positive risk to catch):
             - a no-argument default db.connect() (no literal to see; left to the
               skill's monkeypatch-the-default convention)
             - adjacent string concatenation: connect('/dir/' 'x.db')
             - a triple-quoted one-line DB path
             - pathlib bare-segment joins: Path('/abs/data') / 'x.db'
             - em-dash narration (not a tool call; lives in the skill + style)

Deferral-capture detector coverage (second detector, same enumeration rule):
    CATCHES  deferral language written into a CODE file (suffix allowlist below):
             "out of scope"/"out-of-scope", "fix (it) later", "defer(red) this",
             "leave (this) for later", "won't fix (now)", "punt(ed/ing) on" —
             case-insensitive, comments and strings alike — unless the file
             acks a captured item with # spillover-skip.
    SKIPS    non-code files (docs/PRDs legitimately discuss scope), and any
             file containing the ack marker.
    MISSES   (documented deferrals): synonym phrasings with no listed verb
             ("not in scope", "TODO later", "handle this another day",
             "skip for now", "future work"), deferrals split across lines,
             and non-English phrasing. Your standing gate / CI is the
             enforcement of last resort; this detector is the write-time nudge.

Scope (fast-exit otherwise, token discipline):
    Two detectors, two scopes, evaluated in this order:
    1. Deferral capture runs on ANY code file (suffix allowlist in
       _CODE_SUFFIXES) and can exit 2 on its own.
    2. Test isolation then runs only on a Python TEST file, detected by
       basename test_*.py / *_test.py or a path under a /tests/ directory.
    A non-code, non-test edit (markdown, JSON, config) exits 0 untouched.
