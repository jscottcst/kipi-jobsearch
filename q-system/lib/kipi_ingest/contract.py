"""Fleet-canonical ingestion coverage contract.

Canonical source (PRD prd-fleet-ingestion-coverage-contract-2026-07-06). This
module is skeleton-owned and propagates to every instance via `kipi update`
(git archive q-system/ + rsync --delete), so all document-ingesting tools share
ONE read-boundary contract and cannot drift. A `--check` (conformance.py --check)
is the deterministic gate between updates.

Two composable layers, each distilled from a real sibling tool (audited
2026-07-06):

  Layer 1 COUNTING  (from QEP) -- did we read every unit?
    ReadResult(attempted, captured, truncated, dropped) + reconcile().
    A cap or per-unit failure is COUNTED, never silent. reconcile() raises and
    names any enumerated unit with no result.

  Layer 2 PROVENANCE (from the source product) -- is every kept unit real?
    Block(block_id, text-derived-from-source) + index_blocks() + ground().
    A downstream reference to a unit that was not read raises; "captured"
    becomes unfakeable.

Neither sibling had both halves; together they are the complete receipt.
Stdlib only: the contract carries no parse dependencies (readers own those).
