Token Bleed Guardrail System
Two-layer defense against runaway token consumption in Claude Code sessions.
Layer 1: Hook-based circuit breaker (this script).
Layer 2: CLAUDE.md + .claude/rules/token-discipline.md (behavioral).

Called by three hooks:
  - PreToolUse: counts tool calls and enforces limits
  - PostToolUse (Edit|Write|MultiEdit|Bash): progress resets (successful edit
    clears that file's spiral counter; successful commit clears the volume
    counters)
  - UserPromptSubmit: resets per-message counters + sweeps stale caches

Per-actor budget scoping (sp0-guard-actor-scope):
  Counters are keyed per ACTOR, not per session. Subagent (Task/workflow)
  tool calls fire hooks with the parent's session_id and transcript_path but
  carry their own `agent_id` field — observed live in
  q-system/output/guard-payload-dump.json (2026-06-11): main-session events
  have no agent_id; each spawned agent's events carry a distinct agent_id.
  Cache key: /tmp/claude-guard-{session_id}.json for the main actor,
  /tmp/claude-guard-{session_id}-agent-{agent_id}.json per subagent. A
  spinning single actor still hits its own ceiling; a fan-out no longer
  burns the orchestrator's budget (and a blocked subagent no longer
  deadlocks the parent).

Commit-progress valve (both wirings):
  A successful `git commit` resets the volume counters — the ceiling gates
  lack-of-progress, not raw volume (founder-approved 2026-06-11). Wiring A:
  PostToolUse on Bash (settings.json matcher includes Bash). Wiring B:
  PreToolUse checks whether the repo HEAD commit is newer than the last
  volume reset — this works even when PostToolUse delivery is missing, and
  takes effect live (the script is re-read every hook fire). The
  empty-commit edge is accepted, not defended (same posture as the
  commit-string volume exemption below).

Exit codes:
  0 = allow (optionally with warning via stdout JSON)
  2 = block (stderr message goes to Claude as feedback)
