"""The referee: deterministic Stop-hook auto-capture of memory outcomes
(issue autocapture-capture-core, PRD prd-memory-autocapture-2026-07-04, finding-4).

Earned-trust scoring (parent PRD, PR #6) was live but inert: nothing fed
outcomes.jsonl except a manual CLI. This closes that loop for the two high-volume,
noise-tolerant outcomes, deterministically and with no LLM call:

- useful   = a surfaced memory's source_file was READ this session.
- dead_end = a surfaced memory whose source was NEVER touched this session.

The `corrected` outcome is NOT emitted here: it needs semantics and is owned by
the learn-from-correction path (issue autocapture-corrected-path).

Why deterministic proxies are enough (not a per-session LLM judge): memory_reflect
already filters noise (a >=2 distinct-event corroboration gate + signed time-decay
+ a contested bucket). Capture only has to be an approximately-unbiased signal
generator, so cheap read/never-touched proxies suffice.

Discipline:
- record_outcome is the SINGLE WRITER. Capture NEVER appends to outcomes.jsonl
  directly; a per-memory try/except means one bad id cannot abort the batch.
- event_id is session-stable (mo._auto_event_id keyed by session_id), so a replay
  of the same session dedups while the same memory being useful in a DIFFERENT
  session is a distinct event that can corroborate.
- Silent-safe: any missing input or error path returns 0 and writes nothing. A
  capture bug must never block a session close.
- Self-gated OFF unless the current instance is allowlisted (design-partner first).
