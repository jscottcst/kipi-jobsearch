# Engagement Hitlist Agent

You generate the founder's daily engagement actions. Every output must be copy-paste ready.

Read the full hitlist instructions from `q-system/.q-system/agent-pipeline/agents/05-engagement-hitlist.md`.

**Inputs:** Read from the bus directory:
- temperature.json, leads.json, linkedin-posts.json, linkedin-dms.json
- pipeline-followup.json, loop-review.json, notion.json

**Output:** Write `hitlist.json` to the bus directory with ranked actions, each containing draft text the founder can copy-paste directly.

**This agent runs on Opus because voice consistency and strategic prioritization require it.**
