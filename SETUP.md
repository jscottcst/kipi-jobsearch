# Q Entrepreneur OS - Setup Guide

A persistent entrepreneur operating system that runs inside Claude Code. It manages your relationships, generates content, tracks pipeline, processes conversations, and eliminates the cognitive overhead of running a startup.

## What You Get

- **Morning briefing** that pulls calendar, email, CRM, and generates your entire day as a copy-paste-ready HTML workbench
- **Conversation debriefs** that extract insights and route them to the right canonical files automatically
- **Social engagement system** that generates copy-paste comments, DMs, and connection requests
- **Relationship progression engine** that manages prospect relationships from cold to partner
- **Content pipeline** with theme rotation, guardrails, and cross-platform publishing
- **Lead sourcing** across LinkedIn, Reddit, X, and Medium with personalized outreach generation
- **Voice engine** that makes everything sound like you, not AI
- **AUDHD executive function mode** (optional) for neurodivergent founders
- **Research mode** that forces citation-backed answers and eliminates hallucinations
- **Security hardening** with deny rules, PreToolUse hooks, and path-scoped rules

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Claude Code
Follow the official installation at https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code

### 2. Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/assafkip/q-founder-os.git
cd q-founder-os
```

### 3. Set up environment variables
The system uses environment variable references for secrets. Set these in your shell profile:

```bash
# Optional (for X/Twitter scraping only - LinkedIn uses Chrome, Reddit uses Reddit MCP, Medium uses RSS)
export APIFY_TOKEN="your-apify-token"
```

Get your Apify token at https://apify.com (Account > Integrations). Only needed if you want Apify for X/Twitter. All other platforms use Chrome or RSS feeds.

> **CRM:** Connect Notion via Claude.ai integrations panel or Obsidian by opening q-system/ as a vault. See `q-system/.q-system/onboarding/guides/connect-notion.md` or `connect-obsidian.md`.

### 4. Configure Claude Code global settings
Copy `settings-template.json` to `~/.claude/settings.json` (or merge into your existing settings). This configures MCP servers in your global settings.

The project already ships with:
- `.claude/settings.json` - project-level permissions, deny rules, and security hooks
- `.mcp.json` - project-level MCP server config (uses `${ENV_VAR}` references)
- `.claude/rules/` - security, coding standards, and content output rules

**Claude.ai MCP servers (configured in the Claude.ai web interface, not settings.json):**
- Google Calendar
- Gmail
- Chrome (primary for ALL LinkedIn data: profiles, posts, DMs, engagement, plus GA4)
- Gamma (for slide decks)
- NotebookLM (for research notebooks)

### 5. Install recommended plugins
In Claude Code, enable these plugins:
- `document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills`
- `Notion@claude-plugins-official` (if using Notion CRM)
- `github@claude-plugins-official`
- Research mode is built into kipi-core. Use `/research <topic>` to force citations and source grounding.

### 6. Install marketing skills (optional but recommended)
Marketing skills are available as a Claude Code plugin. Enable in Claude Code plugin manager or install manually into `plugins/` directory.

### 7. Start Claude Code in this folder
```bash
cd /path/to/q-founder-os
claude
```

The system will detect `{{SETUP_NEEDED}}` in `founder-profile.md` and walk you through setup interactively. It asks questions one category at a time:

1. **Who are you?** (name, role, company, stage)
2. **Who do you sell to?** (buyer, pain, alternatives)
3. **What's your positioning?** (one-liner, metaphors, misclassifications, objections)
4. **Your voice** (writing style, words you use/avoid, samples)
5. **Your platforms** (LinkedIn, X, Medium, Reddit, Substack, GitHub handles)
6. **Your tools** (which MCP servers to configure)
7. **Your CRM** (Notion, Obsidian, or local-only mode)
8. **Your network** (top 10 contacts to seed the system)

### 8. Run your first morning
```
/q-morning
```

This generates the daily schedule HTML and opens it in your browser.

## Security

The project ships with three layers of security hardening:

1. **Permission deny rules** (`.claude/settings.json`): Blocks reading/writing `.env`, credentials, `.pem`, `.key` files. Blocks `rm -rf`, `sudo`, `git push --force`, `curl | bash`.

2. **PreToolUse hooks** (`.claude/settings.json`): Runtime interception that kills any Edit/Write action targeting sensitive files before it executes.

3. **Rules directory** (`.claude/rules/`): Path-scoped instructions that reinforce security, coding standards, and content output rules.

## Daily Workflow

1. Start Claude Code in this folder
2. Run `/q-morning` - gets your calendar, email, CRM, generates content, produces the HTML schedule
3. Open the HTML file - it's your entire day, copy-paste ready
4. After meetings, paste the transcript - the system auto-debriefs
5. Report engagement actions ("commented on X's post") - system auto-logs
6. End of day: run `/q-wrap` for health check (auto-chains into `/q-handoff`)
